# 🧠 DSA Practice (Kotlin and Java)

This is my personal repository for practicing data structures and algorithms in **Kotlin** and **Java**. I'm currently working through the **[AlgoMaster.io](https://algomaster.io/practice/dsa-patterns) 300 LeetCode challenge** — a structured, pattern-based roadmap designed to help you master DSA for interviews.
