/* Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0] */

/* We sweep through the array exactly once with two pointersâ€”one tracking where to write the next non-zero, the other scanning every element. Since each element is visited a constant number of times, the overall running time is **O(n)**, where *n* is the length of the array. */
